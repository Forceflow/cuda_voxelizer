# cuda_voxelizer v0.5.2
A command-line tool to convert polygon meshes to (annotated) voxel grids.
 * Supported input formats: .ply, .off, .obj, .3DS, .SM and RAY
 * Supported output formats: .vox, .binvox, .obj cubes and point cloud, morton ordered grid
 * Requires a CUDA-compatible video card. Compute Capability 2.0 or higher (Nvidia Fermi or better).
   * Since v0.4.4, the voxelizer reverts to a (slower) CPU voxelization method when no CUDA device is found

## Usage
Program options:
 * `-f <path to model file>`: **(required)** A path to a polygon-based 3D model file. 
 * `-s <voxel grid length>`: **(default: 256)** The length of the cubical voxel grid. The process will construct the tightest possible cubical bounding box around the input model.
 * `-o <output format>`: The output format for voxelized models, default: *binvox*. Output files are saved in the same folder as the input file, in the format `<original file name>_<grid_size>.extension`.
   * `vox`: **(default)** A [vox](https://github.com/ephtracy/voxel-model/blob/master/MagicaVoxel-file-format-vox.txt) file, which is the native format of and can be viewed with the excellent [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/).
   * `binvox`: A [binvox](http://www.patrickmin.com/binvox/binvox.html) file. Can be viewed using [viewvox](http://www.patrickmin.com/viewvox/).
   * `obj`: A mesh containing actual cubes (made up of triangle faces) for each voxel.
   * `obj_points`: A mesh containing a point cloud, with a vertex for each voxel. Can be viewed using any compatible viewer that can just display vertices, like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) or [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/).
   * `morton`: a binary file containing a Morton-ordered grid. This is an internal format I use for other tools.
 * `-cpu`: Force multi-threaded voxelization on the CPU instead of GPU. Can be used when a CUDA device is not detected/compatible, or for very small models where GPU call overhead is not worth it.
 * `-thrust` : Use Thrust library for copying the model data to the GPU, for a possible speed / throughput improvement. I found this to be very system-dependent. Default: disabled.
 * `-solid` : (Experimental) Use solid voxelization instead of voxelizing the mesh faces. Needs a watertight input mesh.

## Examples
`cuda_voxelizer -f bunny.ply -s 256` generates a 256 x 256 x 256 vox-based voxel model which will be stored in `bunny_256.vox`. 

`cuda_voxelizer -f torus.ply -s 64 -o obj -thrust -solid` generates a solid (filled) 64 x 64 x 64 .obj voxel model which will be stored in `torus_64.obj`. During voxelization, the Cuda Thrust library will be used for a possible speedup, but YMMV.

## Building
The build process is aimed at 64-bit executables. It's possible to build for 32-bit as well, but I'm not actively testing/supporting this.
You can build using CMake or using the provided Visual Studio project. Since 2022, cuda_voxelizer builds via [Github Actions](https://github.com/Forceflow/cuda_voxelizer/actions) as well, check the .[yml config file](https://github.com/Forceflow/cuda_voxelizer/blob/main/.github/workflows/autobuild.yml) for more info.

### Dependencies
The project has the following build dependencies:
 * [Nvidia Cuda 8.0 Toolkit (or higher)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) for CUDA + Thrust libraries (standard included)
 * [Trimesh2](https://github.com/Forceflow/trimesh2) for model importing. Latest version recommended.
 * [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html) for vector math. Any recent version will do.
 * [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) for multi-threading.

### Docker Compose
1. Install Docker & Docker Compose 

Then you can use the app like this:
```bash
docker compose run cuda_voxelizer cuda_voxelizer -o binvox -thrust -f ./test_models/bunny.OBJ -s 256

```
This should create a binvox file in the test_models folder. 
If you have a cuda enabled gpu it will use it(maybe you have to lower the cuda arch variable in the Dockerfile).
You can always add more folders inside of the docker-compose.yml.

With this way, you dont have to install all the dependencies yourself.
In the following ways you have to do the steps described in the Dockerfile yourself.

### Build using CMake (Windows, Linux)

After installing dependencies, do `mkdir build` and `cd build`, followed by:

For Windows with Visual Studio:
```powershell
$env:CUDAARCHS="your_cuda_compute_capability"
cmake -A x64 -DTrimesh2_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH="path_to_trimesh2_include" -DTrimesh2_LINK_DIR:PATH="path_to_trimesh2_library_dir" .. 
```

For Linux:
```bash
CUDAARCHS="your_cuda_compute_capability" cmake -DTrimesh2_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH="path_to_trimesh2_include" -DTrimesh2_LINK_DIR:PATH="path_to_trimesh2_library_dir" -DCUDA_ARCH:STRING="your_cuda_compute_capability" .. 
```
Where `your_cuda_compute_capability` is a string specifying your CUDA architecture ([more info here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/10.2/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html#options-for-steering-gpu-code-generation-gpu-architecture) and [here CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.20/envvar/CUDAARCHS.html#envvar:CUDAARCHS)). For example: `CUDAARCHS="50;61"` or `CUDAARCHS="60"`.

Finally, run
```
cmake --build . --parallel number_of_cores
```

### Build using Visual Studio project (Windows)

A project solution for Visual Studio 2022 is provided in the `msvc` folder. It is configured for CUDA 11, but you can edit the project file to make it work with other CUDA versions. You can edit the `custom_includes.props` file to configure the library locations, and specify a place where the resulting binaries should be placed.

```
    <TRIMESH_DIR>C:\libs\trimesh2\</TRIMESH_DIR>
    <GLM_DIR>C:\libs\glm\</GLM_DIR>
    <BINARY_OUTPUT_DIR>D:\dev\Binaries\</BINARY_OUTPUT_DIR>
```
## Details
`cuda_voxelizer` implements an optimized version of the method described in M. Schwarz and HP Seidel's 2010 paper [*Fast Parallel Surface and Solid Voxelization on GPU's*](http://research.michael-schwarz.com/publ/2010/vox/). The morton-encoded table was based on my 2013 HPG paper [*Out-Of-Core construction of Sparse Voxel Octrees*](http://graphics.cs.kuleuven.be/publications/BLD14OCCSVO/)  and the work in [*libmorton*](https://github.com/Forceflow/libmorton).

`cuda_voxelizer` is built with a focus on performance. Usage of the routine as a per-frame voxelization step for real-time applications is viable. These are the voxelization timings for the [Stanford Bunny Model](https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/) (1,55 MB, 70k triangles). 
 * This is the voxelization time for a non-solid voxelization. No I/O - from disk or to GPU - is included in this timing.
 * CPU voxelization time is heavily dependent on how many cores your CPU has - OpenMP allocates 1 thread per core.

     * [thinvox](https://www.patrickmin.com/thinvox/): Thinning of voxel grids

 * [Zarbuz](https://github.com/zarbuz)'s [FileToVox](https://github.com/Zarbuz/FileToVox) looks interesting as well
 * If you want a good customizable CPU-based voxelizer, I can recommend [VoxSurf](https://github.com/sylefeb/VoxSurf).
 * Another hackable voxel viewer is Sean Barrett's excellent [stb_voxel_render.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_voxel_render.h).
 * Nvidia also has a voxel library called [GVDB](https://developer.nvidia.com/gvdb), that does a lot more than just voxelizing.

## Todo / Possible future work
This is on my list of "nice things to add".

 * Noncubic grid support
 * Memory limits test
 * Implement partitioning for larger models
 * Do a pre-pass to categorize triangles
 * Implement capture of normals / color / texture data
